Description  

This Final Degree Thesis develops a comprehensive study of covering spaces in topology. It begins with foundational concepts such as covering maps and path lifting, then addresses the classification of covering spaces, universal coverings, and covering transformations. The final part explores algebraic applications, focusing on group theory through finite graphs and their fundamental groups.
